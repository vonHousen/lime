            neighborhood_labels: corresponding perturbed labels. should have as

            distances: distances to original data point.

            num_features: maximum number of features in explanation
            feature_selection: how to select num_features. options are:
                'forward_selection': iteratively add features to the model.
                    This is costly when num_features is high
                'highest_weights': selects the features that have the highest
                    product of absolute weight * original data point when
                    learning with all the features
                'lasso_path': chooses features based on the lasso
                    regularization path
                'none': uses all features, ignores num_features
                'auto': uses forward_selection if num_features <= 6, and
                    'highest_weights' otherwise.
            model_regressor: sklearn regressor to use in explanation.
                Defaults to Ridge regression if None. Must have
                model_regressor.coef_ and 'sample_weight' as a parameter
                to model_regressor.fit()

        Returns:
            (intercept, exp, score, local_pred):
            intercept is a float.
            exp is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple (x,y) corresponds
            to the feature id (x) and the local weight (y). The list is sorted
            by decreasing absolute value of y.
            score is the R^2 value of the returned explanation
            local_pred is the prediction of the explanation model on the original instance
